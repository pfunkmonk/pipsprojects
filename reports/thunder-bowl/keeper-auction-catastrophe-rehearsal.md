# Thunder Bowl 2026 — Keeper-to-Auction Catastrophe Rehearsal

Generated: 2026-08-12T23:34:04.460Z

Result: **PASS**

This accepted deterministic gate uses the active validated 716-player practice pack. It records the Herbert cap trade, corrects a mistaken keeper destination with an append-only void, assigns 24 legal keepers, completes the other 144 purchases, rejects an illegal maximum bid, corrects an offline price, merges a 72-sale outage exactly and idempotently, round-trips the full private recovery bundle, and tests the public/private boundary throughout. It satisfies the technical rehearsal gate; it does not claim physical speaking, projector, or venue-network evidence.

- 716 current practice players and 177 authenticated keeper candidates
